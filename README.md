# Coffee-Machine
A simple coffee machine simulation console application where the user can buy, fill storage, and check the remaining inventory. In this project I was able to apply core topics of OOP.  Learned how to use static, non static methods and variables, classes, enums (a lil bit), arrays and many more!
